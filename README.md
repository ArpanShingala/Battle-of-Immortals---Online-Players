# Battle-of-Immortals---Online-Players

This tool is built using JavaFx 2.0.

Prerequisites:
1. Java 8
2. Scene Builder installation
3. Eclipse with JavaFx installed.

Edit the config file and make necessary changes to read the log path and set connect to MySQL database.

Approach:

This tool uses similar approach of tail Linux command. It reads the logs from the files, parses the required logs based on regular expressions and fetches the necessary details from MySQL database.


Any suggestions would be appreciated.
